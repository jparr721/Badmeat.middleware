# Theia

Theia is the greek god of sight. So I naturally named this library after her. The idea of this portion of Zeus is to handle what is "seen". The data analysis will be handled here as well as any superficial changes to data.

### Requirenments
* OpenCV

### Execution
Right now this can only be executed with all of Zeus. This portion will eventually be able to be extended to any project as needed.
